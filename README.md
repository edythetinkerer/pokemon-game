Game Concept: Grim Companions
Your game is a dark fantasy, creature-collecting RPG with a gritty, survival-focused tone inspired by the visual and thematic style of Berserk. It re-imagines the genre by making every battle a high-stakes, consequential decision. The world is a dangerous, unforgiving place where creatures are not just allies but companions in a struggle for survival.

The World and Story
The world is a desolate, war-torn realm, its civilization broken and scattered. The main antagonists are The Corrupted, ancient armored soldiers whose bodies and armor have tragically become one. They are a silent, unfeeling force that is slowly consuming the land, and your journey is a grim necessity to protect what little remains.

In this world, Poké Balls are not common tools but rare, ancient artifacts. They are powerful but finite pieces of technology with a crucial flaw: they require consistent maintenance. When a Poké Ball expires, its containment field fails catastrophically, trapping and killing the creature inside.

The game's story begins with a deep, emotional choice:

You live in a secluded village and are tasked by the elder to venture into a forbidden cave. You can choose to go in barehanded, facing the dangers with only your wits.

Alternatively, you can find a companion in a Poké Ball left behind by a dead trainer who met their end in the cave. This Poké Ball is expired, and the creature inside, loyal to its previous trainer, is both uncooperative and in a permanent state of suffering. Taking it is a solemn act of mercy, a way to give both the trainer and their grieving companion a final rest.

This single, one-time choice sets the tone and stakes for your entire journey.

Core Gameplay Mechanics
The gameplay revolves around a Wound System, a mechanic that adds permanent consequences to every battle. Instead of simply gaining experience and leveling up, your creatures, known as Companions, are physically and mentally changed by their experiences in combat. This system applies to all creatures in the world, including wild ones.

Scars: Minor wounds and tough battles can leave a creature with a permanent scar, a symbol of its hardened resolve. This scar provides a small, lasting stat boost (e.g., increased attack or defense), making the creature stronger and more resilient.

Severe Wounds: A devastating blow could result in a severe wound, like the loss of a limb or a crippling injury. This permanently reduces a creature's stats (e.g., decreased speed) or may force it to change its entire fighting style. For example, a fast, two-handed creature might become a slower, more defensive one-armed fighter.

This system means every battle is a high-stakes decision. Do you risk your companion in a tough fight for a chance at a powerful scar, or do you play it safe to avoid a crippling wound? This makes the world a dynamic place where every wild creature you encounter has its own unique, visible history of conflict
